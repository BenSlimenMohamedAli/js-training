### Task Overview:
You are required to create a todo list web page where users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The page should be interactive.

### Requirements:
1. **Functionality:**
   - Users should be able to add tasks to the list.
   - Tasks should be editable.
   - Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.
   - Tasks should be deletable.
   - Optional: Implement additional features like sorting, filtering, or categorizing tasks.

2. **JavaScript Concepts:**
   - DOM manipulation: Use JavaScript to dynamically add, edit, and delete tasks from the HTML page.
   - Event handling: Utilize event listeners to respond to user actions such as clicks or input changes.
   - Functions: Define and use functions to encapsulate reusable code for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks.
   - Arrays and objects: Store tasks as objects in an array and manipulate them accordingly.
   - Conditional statements: Use if-else or switch statements to handle different actions based on user input.
   - Loops: Utilize loops (e.g., for loop) for iterating through tasks or performing repetitive tasks.
   - Local storage: Implement local storage to persist tasks even after page reload.

3. **Design and Styling:**
   - Encourage creativity in design. You can use CSS to style the todo list page according to your preferences.
   - Emphasize user-friendly design.

### Evaluation:
During the evaluation session, you should be able to:
* Explain the JavaScript concepts you used and how you implemented them in your code.
* Walk through the functionality of your todo list page, demonstrating how users can interact with it.
* Discuss your design choices and justify them based on usability.

### Example Implementation:
Here's a basic example structure to give you an idea:

* HTML:
  - Input field for adding tasks
  - List container to display tasks

* CSS:
  - Styling for the todo list elements

* JavaScript:
  - Functions for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks
  - Event listeners for user interactions
  - Local storage implementation
